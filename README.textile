h1. Tropo Servlet

h2. Overview

The Tropo Servlet component provides the mechanism to host scripting languages in Java and interact with SIP Servlet (JSR 289) systems.  This component sits between the Tropo Shims layer, that provides support for specific scripting languages, and the underlying SIP Servlet and media server platform. The Tropo Servlet leverages the capabilities of JRuby, Jython, Quercus and Rhino to run these scripts directly on the Java Virtual Machine.
